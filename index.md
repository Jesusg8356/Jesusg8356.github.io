### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, Part 1 was a favorite of mine because this was the beginning. It may sound corny, but it's the truth, and it was really
    exciting to dive into the world of C++ for the 1st time. Here, we learned about C++ Style & Formatting and how to properly write
    code. It was pretty simple, but it was a fun and engaging assignment.
    
* Lab 3

    Lab 3, Part 2 was a favorite of mine because this was where we learned about "Double Variables." With that skill, we learned about how to
    convert a measurement of volume from milliliters in the metric system, to various units in the US customary system (teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, and cups). It
    was a bit more difficult then some others that we've done before, but overall, it was a simple assignment.
    
* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was a favorite of mine because this was where we got to play Blackjack. With the various skills that we have learned, such as functions, we were
    able to play Blackjack in the terminal. I'll be honest, this was not an easy task since we were having a few technical issues, but in the end, we were
    able to finish the assignment. Overall, it was probably the most fun assignment.
